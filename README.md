# Serial-Terminal.com
A browser based serial terminal. No plugins. Vanilla javascript. 

I work with 3d printers alot and use a chromebook as my primary device. In the latest verison of chrome a new serial API was exposed allowing javascript web applications to directly connect to serial devices from a web page.

The index.html file contains a bare bones serial terminal with fewer than 100 lines of code between the HTML and the javascript. 

A live version of the serial terminal can be accesed at (https://www.serialterminal.com). Feel free to use it at your pleasure.
