A browser based serial terminal. No plugins. Vanilla javascript. 

I work with 3d printers alot and use a chromebook as my primary device. In the latest verison of chrome a new serial API was exposed allowing javascript web applications to directly connect to serial devices from a web page.

The index.html file contains a bare bones serial terminal with fewer than 150 lines of code between the HTML, CSS and javascript. 

A live version of the serial terminal can be accesed at (https://www.serialterminal.com). Feel free to use it at your pleasure. 

Instructions for use:
1) Load https://www.serialterminal.com
2) Set baud speed from drop down.
3) click connect.
4) select serial device
5) Talk to your serial device from the built in serial console.

Originally created by mmiscool as a simple example. 
ZanzyTHEbar has made some significant improvements and added a settings page exposing more of the connection settings along with doing an xterm.js implementation under the advanced button.
