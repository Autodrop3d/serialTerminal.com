A browser based serial terminal. No plugins. Vanilla javascript. 

I work with 3d printers alot and use a chromebook as my primary device. In the latest verison of chrome a new serial API was exposed allowing javascript web applications to directly connect to serial devices from a web page.

The index.html file contains a bare bones serial terminal with fewer than 150 lines of code between the HTML, CSS and javascript. 

A live version of the serial terminal can be accesed at (https://www.serialterminal.com). Feel free to use it at your pleasure. 

Instructions for use:
1) Load https://www.serialterminal.com
2) Set baud speed from drop down.
3) click connect.
4) select serial device
5) Talk to your serial device from the built in serial console.
